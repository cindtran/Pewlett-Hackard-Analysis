# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview ##

Used SQL to analyze data

## Purpose ##

Pewlett Hackard is preparing for several employee retirements. As they prep for the change in the organization, they needed to review the employee to determine the eligibility for retirement within their employees. 

The purpose of this analysis is to create data tables to determine the number of retiring employees and to figure out the employees who qualify for the mentorship progream.

First database includes the number of employees and their positions:

Second database includes employee number, first and last name, birth date, employement timeframe and title:
[mentor_eligibility.csv](https://github.com/cindtran/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/files/9286024/mentor_eligibility.csv)

## Results ##

After reviewing the tables, there are 90,398 employees who are eligible for retirement. 33% of the employees are senior engineers and they take priority when it comes to retirement status. Among the employees who can retire, 1,549 of them qualify for the mentorship program. 

How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?

90,398 positions will need to be filled.

Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?

No, there are not enough employees in the mentorship program to make up the gap. The company would need to create a program or system to cover the difference of employees retiring.
